Known issues:

* Crapload of warnings from importing gtk and xlib. Nothing I can do about that,
needs to be fixed upstream.

* When you start editing a cell and then press tab to change cells,
the edit is lost. For now just hit enter first to make the edit stick,
then tab to the next column.

* Main window cannot be focused (so accels and escape key won't work). I'm
working on allowing focus and using wnck screen get_previously_active_window(),
but it doesn't seem to work consistently. Might be fixed in v0.4 (however, due
to the fact that I'm lazy, it will probably never be fixed).


Fun stuff:

* Rows in the preferences tree can be dragged to reorder (or use the up and
down buttons).

* Escape exits preference window and saves prefs.

* Escape completely exits main window (but see above about focus).
