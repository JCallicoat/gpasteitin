Installation:

sudo ./setup.py install --record install_log

NOTE: You need to run migrate.py from the root directory if installing over a previous
      version that's less than 0.7!


Usage:

Start from Gnome Menu -> Accessories, or run "gpasteitin" command.


Uninstallation:

cat install_log | sudo xargs rm -rf


Run without installation:

./gpasteitin/gpasteitin.py


Known issues:

* Crapload of warnings on stdout from importing gtk and xlib. Nothing I can do about that,
needs to be fixed upstream.

* Main window cannot be focused (so accels and escape key won't work). I'm
working on allowing focus and using wnck screen get_previously_active_window(),
but it doesn't seem to work consistently. Might be fixed later (however, due
to the fact that I'm lazy, it will probably never be fixed--feel free to contribue patches).


Fun stuff:

* Rows in the preferences tree can be dragged to reorder (or use the up and
down buttons).

* Escape/close button exits preference window but DOES NOT save preferences.

* Escape completely exits main window (but see above about focus).

* Each profile remembers its last window position.
